# objectified-api

This is the data project that accompanies Objectified.

It contains the OpenAPI 3.1.x specification for the application, along with the database
definition for the DAO/DTO layer.

## Building the application

To build the `api` library, run:

```shell
sh build.sh
```

This will build the autogenerator.
